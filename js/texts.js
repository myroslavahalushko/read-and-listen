window['text'] = [`Advertising is a message that tries to sell something. Companies advertise everything from cars to candy. Advertising is also used to change people's 
                ideas. For example, an ad (advertisement) could try to make voters choose a certain candidate for president. Ads appear almost everywhere you look. 
                You find them on the radio and on TV, in magazines, shop windows and on T shirts. They show up inside elevators, on school buses and even in schools. 
                About 600 billion dollars are spent on advertising around the world every year. Advertising does two main jobs. It tells people about
                something, like a product or a service and it also works to make people want to buy the product or service. Ads (advertisements) do their jobs in many 
                different ways. Many printed ads have headlines or boldly printed words that make people stop and read them. The headline may promise something that 
                the reader wants, like a good price. Other headlines may carry the announcement of a new product. Some ads use slogans that are used over and over again. 
                They are easy to remember and often use a catchy phrase. Sometimes slogans are not related to the product. Some ads use slogans that are used over and 
                over again. They are easy to remember and often use a catchy phrase. Sometimes slogans are not related to the product. In many ads a famous person 
                talks about a product and tells why they use it. This person may be an actor, a model or a well-known athlete. Or they may just be an average user of a product. 
                Ads also compare a product with another one of the same type. The ad points out why a product is better. Some ads feature cartoon or product characters. 
                They may appear in an ad over a long time. The characters become well known and people identify them with a product. Repetition is one of the most basic 
                techniques used in the advertising business. Advertisers broadcast their commercials several times a day for days or weeks to get the message across. 
                When people see an ad more often they may be more likely to accept the message and want the product.`,

                `Birds are animal with feathers. Because they can fly, they are the fastest animals on Earth. Some birds can reach speeds of up to 160km an hour. 
                However, not all birds can fly. Some birds, like ostriches can run and penguins can swim. There are about 10,000 kinds of birds. The smallest bird 
                is the hummingbird which gets only about 5cm big and the largest one is the ostrich which may grow up to 2.5 metres tall. Birds live everywhere in the 
                world—from the cold polar regions to the rain forests of Africa. There are birds, like ducks or seagulls that always live near water. Many birds from 
                colder areas migrate to warmer regions to avoid harsh winters, but others stay in their living area all through the year. All birds hatch from eggs. 
                Female birds lay their eggs in nests that they build. Baby birds remain in the nest for several weeks or months after hatching. Their parents feed 
                them and care for them until they are old enough to leave them. We need birds for many reasons. In nature, birds eat fruit and carry the seeds from 
                flower to flower. Some birds, like chickens and ducks provide us with meat or eggs. Others help farmers eat insects that attack their fields.
                But some birds are thought to be more dangerous than helpful. Starlings and pigeons have become numerous in cities and make lots of dirt.                
                People have always hunted birds for food. Turkeys or ducks are hunted because of their valuable meet. Farmers today produce hundreds of millions 
                of chickens every year for meat. Birds can also be kept as pets. Parrots and canaries are very common pets because they can be trained to talk or to whistle. 
                Birds migrate to certain places in order to get food and water all year round. They also travel to other places to escape from extreme weather and temperatures. 
                Seabirds are the greatest travellers. Some of them travel over a distance of 30,000km or more every year. Migrating birds have many ways of finding out 
                the right direction. They help themselves by using the position of the sun or moon during the daytime and watch the stars at night.
                Some of them get help from familiar things they see or hear.`,

                `Chinese New Year is the most important holiday of the Chinese calendar. 
                The New Year begins between January 21 and February 20. The celebration 
                starts with the second new moon after the beginning of winter (December 21) and lasts until the next full moon.
                The Chinese name their years after 12 different animals: the rat, the ox, the tiger, the hare, the dragon, 
                the snake, the horse, the sheep, the monkey, the rooster, the dog, the pig. Some people believe that 
                a human being's personality and character depends on the animal of the year he or she was born.                
                The Chinese New Year marks the start of the next animal's year. After the year of the pig the 
                twelve year cycle starts over again with the year of the rat.                
                A lot of things are done for Chinese New Year. Houses are cleaned from 
                top to bottom in the days before the beginning of the holidays. People write merry wishes 
                on red paper and hang them all over the house. Rooms are decorated with flowers, plants and oranges.                
                On New Year's Eve firecrackers send out the old year and welcome the new one. At midnight people 
                open all their doors and windows to let the old year out. On New Year's Day children and adults who 
                are not married get red envelopes with money in them. This is a symbol of good look and wealth in the new year.                
                Food plays an important part in Chinese New Year celebrations. Special dishes are eaten on certain days. 
                Many kinds of food have special meanings. Uncut noodles, for example, might give you a longer life. People 
                who eat a lot of raw fish are said to be more successful in life.                
                The last event of the 15-day celebration is the Lantern Festival. Some people hang 
                glowing lanterns in temples. Others carry lanterns in a moonlight parade. In many places long 
                colourful dragons made out of silk, paper and bamboo are carried on the streets by dancers.`,
                
                `Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during 
                the geologic middle ages of the Earth's history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. 
                Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth.
                The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. 
                During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge 
                continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. 
                Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the 
                Age of Dinosaurs was different than today's. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. 
                The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers 
                that had cones on them emerged. Ferns and mosses also appeared on the Earth.
                Dinosaurs were land animals that lived in almost all parts of the world, from tropical 
                regions to deserts. They came in many different sizes and had different body shapes. 
                Some were huge creatures, up to 40 meters long and a hundred tons in weight. Others were as small as a chicken. 
                Most dinosaurs had a scaly skin with no hair on their bodies. Although we often think dinosaurs were grey, 
                dull creatures, experts think that some of them could have been really colorful. 
                Until today scientists don’t really know if dinosaurs were cold- or warm-blooded animals. 
                They had their own way of regulating their body temperature.
                Dinosaurs became extinct towards the end of the Mesozoic era, about 65 million years ago. 
                Although there are still some mysteries left most scientists think that a drastic 
                change in climate killed them. Winters became too cold for dinosaurs to survive.
                Another theory says that a huge asteroid hit the Earth at that time. It whirled 
                so much dust and gas into the atmosphere that sunlight was blocked out for millions of years.
                Dinosaurs probably starved to death because there was no food.`,

                `An earthquake is one of the worst natural disasters on our earth. We think that the ground we stand on is very stable, but it isn't. It moves quite a lot. 
                In the last few decades scientists have been able to find out why earthquakes happen. Earthquakes happen when there is a sudden vibration in the earth's crust. 
                It's like a large lorry that travels down your street. When it passes by, you feel your house shake. In the middle of the 20th century scientists found out 
                that continents do not always stay in the same place. They have been moving on plates for millions of years. The earth's surface is made up of many such plates. 
                Where two plates meet magma comes out of the inner part of the earth. These areas are called faults—breaks in the earth's crust.
                Sometimes people can make earthquakes happen. They can fill man-made lakes with water after building a dam—or they test atomic bombs underground. 
                Some of these tests can help scientists find out how quakes happen. With a machine called a seismograph scientists can tell where an earthquake happened 
                and how strong it was. The place in the earth where the movement takes place is called the focus or hypocentre. From here, waves start to spread out in 
                all directions. This focus can be very near to the surface or it can be hundreds of km below it. The area on the surface exactly above the focus 
                is called the epicentre. This is the place where the waves hit first and where the most damage is done. Whenever an earthquake hits us you 
                hear how powerful it is. The Richter Scale is used to rate the magnitude of earthquakes. Small quakes have a rating of under 4. 
                You won't see a lot of damage here. Medium-sized earthquakes reach between 5 and 7 on the scale, and the really big ones are above 7. 
                The largest earthquake that has ever been registered was at 9.5 on the Richter scale. There are more than 100 seismograph stations all 
                over the world. When the earth shakes seismologists compare the information they get and then they can tell where the earthquake really happened.`,
                
                `Everything is made up of atoms. Each one of them has three particles: protons, neutrons and electrons. Electrons spin around the centre of an atom. 
                They have a negative charge. Protons, which are in the centre of atoms, have a positive charge.Normally, an atom has as many protons as it has electrons. 
                It is stable or balanced. Carbon, for example has six protons and six electrons. Scientists can make electrons travel from one atom to another. 
                An atom that loses electrons is positively charged, an atom that gets more electrons is negatively charged. Electricity is created when electrons 
                move between atoms. Positive atoms look for free negative electrons and attract them, so that they can be balanced.
                When electrons move through a conductor an electric current is created. A current that always flows in one direction is called a direct current (DC). 
                A battery for example, produces a direct current. A current that flows back and forth is called an alternating current (AC).
                Electrons cannot jump freely through the air to a positively charged atom. They need a circuit to move. When a source of energy, like a battery, 
                is connected to a light bulb the electrons can move from the battery to the light bulb and back again. We call this an electric circuit.
                Sometimes there are many circuits in an electrical device that make it work. A TV set or a computer may have millions of parts that are 
                connected to each other in different ways. You can stop the current from flowing by putting a switch into the circuit. 
                You can open the circuit and stop electrons from moving. A piece of metal or wire can also be used to produce heat. When an electrical 
                current passes through such metal it can be slowed down by resistance. This causes friction and makes the wires hot. That's why you 
                can toast your bread in a toaster or dry your hair with warm air from a hairdryer. The electricity produced by a generator travels along 
                cables to a transformer that changes the voltage of electricity. Power lines carry the high-voltage electricity over very long distances.`,

                `Golf is one of the most popular outdoor sports in the world. It is played on a golf course. Players try to hit a golf ball into a small 
                hole with as few strokes as possible. Millions of men and women around the world play golf for fun, thousands play tournaments and millions 
                around the world watch golf on TV. Golf courses have different sizes and shapes. Most of them have 18 holes that are between a hundred and 
                500 metres long. If you have finished playing all 18 holes you have played a round of golf. Each hole has a starting place, called a tee. 
                This is a small area from which the golfer takes the first stroke or drive. The grass between the tee and the green is called the fairway. 
                Sometimes fairways can be very long and golf players need a few strokes to get to the green. The land on the left and right of the fairway 
                is the rough. It is made up of tall grass, bushes and trees. The green is the round area at the end of the fairway. It has special grass 
                that is very short. In the middle of the green is a hole. It has a flag placed in it so that golfers can see where it is. Almost all golf 
                courses have hazards. These are small lakes, sandy areas and bunkers. They make it more difficult for players to hit the ball. In a tournament 
                golf players can use up to 14 different types of golf clubs. Each club is used to play the ball in a different situation. Generally, there are two 
                basic categories of clubs: woods and irons. They are numbered from 1 to 9. Woods were originally clubs that had a wooden head. Today they have heads 
                made of steel or titanium. Golfers use woods to hit the ball over long distances. A number one wood is also called a driver. Players use this club to 
                start their game at the tee. Irons have heads that are thinner and flatter. Instead of iron, the club has a head made of steel or another metal. 
                Irons are used for shorter shots and shots where you must play the ball very accurately. The putter is a club that is used on the green for very short distances. `,

                `Gravity is a force that attracts objects. It is also the force that makes objects fall down when you drop them. Because of gravity things on earth have 
                a certain weight. Gravity on Earth pulls objects to the centre of the planet. Every time you throw a ball up into the air it is pulled back to Earth. 
                This occurs in nature all the time. Ancient astronomers observed the movements of the moon and the planets across the sky very carefully. In the 17th 
                century the English scientist and mathematician Isaac Newton wondered why the moon and the planets didn't simply fly off into outer space but always 
                moved in a curve around the Earth and the sun. He found out that the same force that pulled an apple back to the ground also kept the moon moving around 
                the Earth. He discovered that the moon's orbit is the result of two different movements. The first motion makes the moon fly along a straight line in space. 
                A planet will always follow such a line if nothing else changes its direction or speed. The second force pulls the moon towards the Earth. If you put both
                movements together you get a curved path around the Earth. Newton also found out that every body or object has a force of gravity, and that every body pulls 
                other bodies towards it. He also explained that gravity depends on the mass of an object or the amount of material that it has. Therefore the sun, which has 
                a very large mass, has a greater force of gravity than the Earth, so the Earth moves around the sun. The moon goes around the Earth because the Earth's 
                gravity is larger than the moon's. The force of gravity also depends on the distance between two objects. If they are close together gravity between them 
                is greater. Mass and weight are not the same. The mass of a body, its volume, always stays the same. Weight is the pull of gravity on an object. On Earth, 
                an astronaut may weigh 70kg. However when the same astronaut walks on the moon he weighs only a sixth – about 12kg because the moon has less mass than the 
                Earth and therefore its gravitational pull is smaller.`,

                `James Bond is an English secret agent who was created by the British novelist Ian Fleming. The character of Bond became popular not only through Fleming's 
                books but through many movies. Bond, also known as agent 007, is an attractive man who likes women. Fleming introduced Bond in his first novel Casino Royale in 1953.
                Fleming was born in 1908 into a wealthy Scottish family. His grandfather was a banker who, after his death, left Ian's family a fortune. After going to school at 
                Eton he attended the military academy at Sandhurst, but he didn’t like it there and left without becoming an officer. He continued his education in the Austrian 
                town of Kitzbühel, where nobody his real identity. After coming back to Britain Fleming got a job as a journalist with the news agency Reuters and then went into 
                banking. Both jobs did not please him very much, so in May 1939 he started working for the Foreign Office. There he became the assistant of one of Britain's top spymasters.
                During the last year of the war Fleming travelled to Jamaica to a naval conference. He fell in love with the island and built himself a house, which he called Goldeneye. 
                For six years he travelled back and forth from Britain to Jamaica, where he spent the winter, met lovely women, and enjoyed the sunset. He quit the Foreign Office 
                and turned to writing. James Bond is probably one of the most famous and longest running characters in film history. 
                Since his first appearance in Dr. No (1962) the Queen's number one spy has travelled to more places, romanced more women, escaped from more dangerous situations 
                and saved the world more times than any other secret agent in history. After the war he entered the British Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, 
                where he became a "double-0" agent with a license to kill. His assignments have taken him to volcanic islands, India, Las Vegas and even a space station in orbit. 
                He has charm, loves beautiful women, and likes martinis - shaken, not stirred-, fine suits and fast cars. Most of Bond's missions bring him into contact with shadowy 
                figures of the underworld.`,

                `Stars are the most fascinating objects in the sky. They are gigantic balls of gas that people have been interested throughout history. Although they are so 
                big they look small because they are so far away. Humans have always told stories about stars gave them names and saw patterns in them. The most important 
                star is the sun. Planets revolve around the centre of the solar system. Our sun is a medium sun, about the same size as most of the other stars in the universe. 
                It consists of hydrogen and helium, which combine to produce energy. This reaction, that makes stars shine so brightly, is called fusion. The temperature on 
                the surface of the sun is about 10,000° C, while the core is thousands of times hotter. Stars are organized in clusters called galaxies. Our sun, 
                together with the solar system is a part of our galaxy, the Milky Way. It is only one of billions of other galaxies in the universe. Stars often look so 
                small because they are so far away. The nearest star is Alpha Centauri. It takes light from this star about 4.5 years to reach the earth. The billions 
                of stars in our universe have different sizes and colors. Some shine yellow like the sun, others are red, white or blue. The color of a star tells us how 
                hot it is. Blue stars are the hottest and red ones the coldest ones. As for size, astronomers speak of giants and dwarfs. The dimmest stars in the universe 
                are the red dwarfs. They are very small and only have a surface temperature about 3,000° C. Proxima Centauri is such a red dwarf. Although it is as far 
                away as Alpha Centauri we can only see it through a telescope. The biggest stars in our universe are the blue supergiants. They shine a million times 
                brighter than our sun and have a surface temperature of up to 60,000° C. Because they shine so brightly we can see those that are very far away. 
                Stars begin as clouds of dust and hydrogen, called nebulas. When they get hot enough they start burning hydrogen and produce energy. This process, 
                called fusion, can last billions of years. When a star runs out of hydrogen the fusion process stops and it starts cooling down.`
